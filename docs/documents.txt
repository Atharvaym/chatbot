REST vs GraphQL - A Detailed Comparison

1. REST Protocols:
- REST (Representational State Transfer) follows a resource-based architecture.
- Uses multiple endpoints, stateless communication, and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Common use cases: Public APIs, caching-heavy applications, CRUD-based systems.

2. GraphQL Protocols:
- A query language allowing clients to request specific data.
- Operates on a single endpoint, strongly-typed schema, supports real-time updates (subscriptions).
- Used for complex frontend applications, mobile apps, and data aggregation.

3. Key Differences:
- REST uses multiple endpoints; GraphQL has a single endpoint.
- REST may overfetch/underfetch data, while GraphQL fetches precisely what is needed.
- REST supports HTTP caching natively, whereas GraphQL requires custom caching.
- REST error handling is based on HTTP status codes, while GraphQL returns 200 OK with error details.

4. When to Use:
- Choose REST for caching, file uploads, and simpler APIs.
- Use GraphQL for mobile apps, complex data fetching, and real-time updates.

Conclusion:
Both REST and GraphQL have advantages. Choose based on API complexity, client needs, and performance requirements.
